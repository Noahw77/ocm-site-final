      <h2>How we invest</h2>
      <p>We invest primarily in U.S.-listed technology, media, and telecom companies, with an emphasis on business quality, durability, and long-term fundamentals. We construct a concentrated portfolio of exceptional companies purchased at attractive valuations, aiming to compound capital tax‑efficiently over time by using temporary market dislocations and sentiment‑driven sell‑offs to our advantage.</p>
