      <h2>How we invest</h2>
      <p>We focus primarily on U.S.-listed technology, media, and telecom companies. By exploiting temporary market dislocations and sentiment-driven pressures, we acquire exceptional businesses at attractive valuations. Through a concentrated portfolio of our highest-conviction holdings, we compound capital tax-efficiently over long horizons to deliver superior returns.</p>
      <p>Our framework could be applied broadly, but we believe our greatest edge lies in technology—where deep expertise and long experience give us a decisive advantage.</p>
